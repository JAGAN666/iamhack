# ðŸš€ Deploy to Vercel - Step by Step Guide

## Your Academic NFT Marketplace is Ready for Production!

All bugs have been fixed and the code has been pushed to GitHub. Follow these steps to deploy:

## Step 1: Go to Vercel
1. Open your browser and go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account (if not already signed in)

## Step 2: Import Your Project
1. Click **"New Project"** or **"Add New..."** â†’ **"Project"**
2. Select **"Import Git Repository"**
3. Find your repository: `JAGAN666/iamhack` 
4. Click **"Import"**

## Step 3: Configure Project Settings
Vercel should automatically detect:
- **Framework Preset**: Next.js
- **Root Directory**: `frontend` (let Vercel auto-detect)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (auto-detected)
- **Output Directory**: `.next` (auto-detected)

âœ… **Leave all settings as default** - our configuration will handle everything!

## Step 4: Environment Variables (Optional)
For the demo version, **no environment variables are required**. All API endpoints will work with default settings.

If you want to add optional features later:
```bash
# Optional - for enhanced features
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your-service-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your-template-id  
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key
```

## Step 5: Deploy
1. Click **"Deploy"**
2. Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
3. ðŸŽ‰ Your site will be live at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## Step 6: Test Your Live Site

Once deployed, test these key features:

### âœ… Authentication
- Go to `/login`
- Login with: `demo@student.edu` / `demo123`
- Verify NO "verify email" message appears in dashboard

### âœ… API Endpoints
