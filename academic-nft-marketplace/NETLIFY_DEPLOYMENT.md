# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Academic NFT Marketplace to Netlify.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- A Netlify account
- Your project code pushed to a GitHub repository

## 🔧 Project Configuration

The project is already configured for Netlify deployment with:

- ✅ `netlify.toml` configuration file
- ✅ Next.js static export configuration
- ✅ PWA (Progressive Web App) setup
- ✅ Build scripts configured

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Method 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Netlify deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up/Login with your GitHub account
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose your repository

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - **Build command**: `cd frontend && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `frontend/out`
   - **Node version**: `18` (already set in netlify.toml)

4. **Environment Variables** (Optional)
   Add these in Netlify dashboard if needed:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your-wallet-connect-project-id
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait for build to complete
   - Your site will be live at `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

### Method 2: Netlify CLI

1. **Install Netlify CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Netlify**
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=out
   ```

### Method 3: Manual Upload

1. **Build locally**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload to Netlify**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Drag and drop the `frontend/out` folder
   - Your site will be deployed instantly

## 🔧 Build Configuration

The project uses the following configuration:

### netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  base = "."
  publish = "frontend/out"
  command = "cd frontend && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
```

### next.config.js
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  trailingSlash: true,
  images: {
    unoptimized: true
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build fails with dependency conflicts**
   - Solution: Use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag (already configured)

2. **Images not loading**
   - Solution: Images are configured as `unoptimized: true` for static export

3. **API calls failing**
   - Solution: Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable in Netlify

4. **PWA not working**
   - Solution: PWA is already configured with `next-pwa`

### Build Logs

If deployment fails, check the build logs in Netlify dashboard for specific error messages.
